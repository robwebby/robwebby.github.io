=================

This example demonstrates how the FME Server Data Download Service can be used for point cloud data distribution. It lets users download point cloud datasets customized to their needs based on a series of parameters that they can set. The parameters let them choose the output point cloud format, output coordinate system, an area of interest to which the results will be clipped, whether or not to split the output (either by return value or classification), and whether or not to reduce the number of points in the output by using a thinning algorithm.
